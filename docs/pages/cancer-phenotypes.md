## Workshop goals
- Harmonize multimodal cancer data
- Assess the suitability of existing terminologies and value set mappings for describing cancer phenotypic data
- Transform cancer phenotypic data into Phenopackets using LinkML
- Design an API for cancer phenotypic data access
- Complete development of the C2P package to transform cancer data into Phenopackets (see https://github.com/monarch-initiative/c2p/blob/main/notebooks/Individual.ipynb), connecting the current elements of the Phenopacket schema to the existing ETL platform from the Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA)
- Leverage modeling and mapping work done by the Center for Cancer Data Harmonization (CCDH) in the software engineering of the C2P/Phenopackets project and use them together to support AI/ML
- Launch molecular data pilot to represent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) variants.

## Detailed Agenda

### Saturday, September 23, 2023

- Welcoming remarks – logistics, goals
- Introductions
- Intro to the landscape of existing resources
- Exploring the CCDH model, LinkML, and the Phenopackets schema


### Sunday, September 24, 2023

- Cancer phenotypic data modeling discussion
- Transformation pipeline: CRDC → LinkML → phenopackets 
- Building a basic API endpoint 
- Connecting elements of the Phenopacket Schema to ETL code from the Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA) and its API


### Monday, September 25, 2023

- Launch the pilot to test the molecular hypothesis about variants in EGFR
- Wrap up collaborative work, plan next steps, issue a list of actionable items, and identify product owners
