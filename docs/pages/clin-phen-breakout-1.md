# Breakout 1

During this breakout, we will have 4 groups focused on disease topics

## Topics:

- Down syndrome and Heart disease
- Cancer
- Craniofacial disorders
- Scoliosis and Laterality birth defects
 
## Discussion questions:

- Specific data type/biological issues?
- What are they doing about these problems now?
- What standards and methods exist that might help?
- What queries would you want to do within your dataset?
- How might they imagine harmonizing phenotypes to support translational interoperability for mechanism discovery? E.g. cross domain or cross species?
