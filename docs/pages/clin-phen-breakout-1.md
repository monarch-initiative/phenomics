# Kids First Workshop Breakout 1

During this breakout, we will have 4 groups focused on disease topics

## Topics:

- Down syndrome and Heart disease
- Cancer
- Craniofacial disorders
- Scoliosis and Laterality birth defects
 
## Discussion questions:

- Specific data type/biological issues? What are they doing about these problems now? 
- What standards and methods are you using now??
- What queries would you want to do within your disease area?
- What type of analyses might you want to perform if you had maximally available and perfectly curated data? 
- How might you imagine harmonizing phenotypes to support translational interoperability for mechanism discovery? E.g. cross domain or cross species.

## Group Exercise
1. Note our biggest problems.
2. We will discuss as a group and categorize these issues.
