### Background

As more [Kids First](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/) genomic datasets become accessible to the research community, it is becoming more apparent that deeper, harmonized clinical and phenotypic data will be critical to empower genetic discovery and cross-dataset analyses, which will ultimately lead to improved diagnostics and therapies. 
Some grant mechanisms such as [NOT-DE-19-016](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DE-19-016.html) and [RFA-RM-19-012](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-19-012.html) can be used to support such activities, but standards are needed to ensure that additional data collection efforts will lead to stronger Kids First datasets in the Data Resource. Many [Kids First X01 investigators](https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/x01projects) have the ability to re-contact study participants to collect deeper phenotype data, or they need guidance and resources to extract data from existing medical records, surveys, or other documents. As we build an increasingly diverse community of researchers around Kids First, key players including developmental biologists and tool developers, working alongside the Data Resource Center (DRC) and X01 investigators, can inform additional phenotyping and data collection efforts. 

### Purpose

This event is co-planned by the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/) and the [Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC)](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/). Our goal is to improve phenotype data collection and harmonization of Kids First datasets ([The Discovery of the Genetic Basis of Childhood Cancers and of Structural Birth Defects X01 cohorts](https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/x01projects)) and generate a core/consensus set of clinical/phenotypic data elements that are extremely important for Kids First childhood cancer and structural birth defects datasets, and potential overlapping etiologies of these conditions. Another goal is to brainstorm ideas for developing tools and resources for collecting deeper (in some cases disease- or modality- specific) data that will be valuable for increasing understanding of individual pediatric conditions. Kids First X01 investigators, developmental biologists, ontologists, and tool developers will be brought together to inform this process.
