### Background

As more [Kids First](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/) genomic datasets become accessible to the research community, it is becoming more apparent that deeper, harmonized clinical and phenotypic data will be critical to empower genetic discovery and cross-dataset analyses, which will ultimately lead to improved diagnostics and therapies. 
Some grant mechanisms such as [NOT-DE-19-016](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DE-19-016.html) and [RFA-RM-19-012](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-19-012.html) can be used to support such activities, but standards are needed to ensure that additional data collection efforts will lead to stronger Kids First datasets in the Data Resource. Many [Kids First X01 investigators](https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/x01projects) have the ability to re-contact study participants to collect deeper phenotype data, or they need guidance and resources to extract data from existing medical records, surveys, or other documents. As we build an increasingly diverse community of researchers around Kids First, key players including developmental biologists and tool developers, working alongside the Data Resource Center (DRC) and X01 investigators, can inform additional phenotyping and data collection efforts. 

### Purpose

This event is co-planned by the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/) and the [Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC)](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/). Our goal is to improve phenotype data collection and harmonization of Kids First datasets ([The Discovery of the Genetic Basis of Childhood Cancers and of Structural Birth Defects X01 cohorts](https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/x01projects)) and generate a core/consensus set of clinical/phenotypic data elements that are extremely important for Kids First childhood cancer and structural birth defects datasets, and potential overlapping etiologies of these conditions. Another goal is to brainstorm ideas for developing tools and resources for collecting deeper (in some cases disease- or modality- specific) data that will be valuable for increasing understanding of individual pediatric conditions. Kids First X01 investigators, developmental biologists, ontologists, and tool developers will be brought together to inform this process.  

## Agenda

**Session 1: Perspectives on Phenotyping (Childhood Cancer and Structural Birth Defects Cohorts).** What are the most informative translational questions? What is the value of collecting additional phenotype data?  
  
_Confirmed speakers:_
- Melissa Haendel: Computational Perspectives and Ontologies 101
- Philip Lupo: Epidemiological Perspective on phenotyping efforts relevant to childhood cancer and structural birth defects research and the overlap of these pediatric conditions in the population
- Deanne Taylor: Analysis: Gaps in current Kids First datasets

**Session 2: [X01 Investigator](https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/x01projects) Lightning Rounds.** In this session, the X01 investigators will describe their phenotyping efforts (e.g. data dictionaries, standards, methods used) and ideas for how they could be improved for both clinical utility as well as translational discovery.  
_Confirmed speakers:_  
 - Philip Lupo
 - Carole Wise
 - Joaquin Espinosa
 - Stephanie Ware
 - Stephanie Sherman

**Session 3: Phenotypes in harmony.** What standards and methods exist to create harmonize phenotypes and support translational interoperability for mechanism discovery? 
  
_Speaker:_ Melissa Haendel

**Session 4: Breakout session I.** Small Breakouts will include translational teams of X01 investigators, developmental biologists and basic researchers, tool developers and ontologists/data modelers. The breakouts will focus on defining end-to-end phenotype collection to integration processes to address specific clinical or translational questions.

**Session 5: Tools to support strengthening Kids First phenotypic datasets**

**Session 6: Breakout II: Generate “Kids First” phenotype data collection standards**

**Session 7: Group Discussion: What are the next steps?** How to continue to develop these standards? How to communicate the standards with other Kids First researchers?:  

**Session 8: Neurodevelopmental Outcomes**
