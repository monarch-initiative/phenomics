## Clinical-Phenotype Data Workshop 

_Tentative agenda_

### Background

As more Kids First genomic datasets become accessible to the research community, it is becoming more apparent that deeper, harmonized clinical and phenotypic data will be critical to empower genetic discovery and cross-dataset analyses, which will ultimately lead to improved diagnostics and therapies. 
The [Kids First X01 FOA](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-19-104.html) states that “Future activities may include mechanisms to support collection of additional information from existing cohorts or to support data mining activities.” Some grant mechanisms such as NOT-DE-19-016 can be used to support such activities, but standards are needed to ensure that additional data collection efforts will lead to stronger Kids First datasets in the Data Resource. Many Kids First X01 investigators have the ability to re-contact study participants to collect deeper phenotype data, or they need guidance and resources to extract data from existing medical records, surveys, or other documents. As we build an increasingly diverse community of researchers around Kids First, key players including developmental biologists and tool developers, working alongside the Data Resource Center (DRC), can inform additional phenotyping and data collection efforts. 

### Purpose

The goal of this workshop to generate a core/consensus set of clinical/phenotypic data elements that are extremely important for Kids First childhood cancer and structural birth defects datasets, and potential overlapping etiologies of these conditions. Another goal is to brainstorm ideas for developing tools and resources for collecting deeper (in some cases disease- or modality- specific) data that will be valuable for increasing understanding of individual pediatric conditions. Kids First X01 investigators, developmental biologists, ontologists, and tool developers will be brought together to inform this process. 

### Day 1

**Session 1:** Perspectives on Phenotyping (Childhood Cancer and Structural Birth Defects Cohorts)

**Session 2:** X01 Investigator Lightning Rounds

**Session 3:** Which standards exist? Which should we use?

**Session 4:** Breakout session (TBD)

### Day 2 

**Intro:** Summarize Discussions from Day 1

**Session 5:** Tools to support strengthening Kids First phenotypic datasets

**Session 6:** Breakout II: Generate “Kids First” phenotype data collection standards

**Group Discussion:** What are the next steps? How to continue to develop these standards? How to communicate the standards with other Kids First researchers?  

**Session 7:** Neurodevelopmental Outcomes
