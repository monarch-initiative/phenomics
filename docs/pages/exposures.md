### Computable Exposures Workshop 

**Dates:** September 9-10, 2019  
**Location:** Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon  
**Workshop Organizers:** Anne Thessan (OSU) and Melissa Haendel (OSU/OHSU)

#### Focus area
A critical challenge in advancing human health is identifying genetic etiologies and environmental risk factors for disease, but the environmental component of human disease is extremely underrepresented in publicly available data sets. Without exposure information,  our ability to understand human disease and realize precision health is limited, even with the promise of modern genomics. Numerous challenges impede our progress in using exposure data collectively including the lack of terminology standards and computable data models. For such resources to be effective in leveraging exposure data development there must be a broad community effort. To this end, the computable exposures workshop brought together a diverse community of toxicologists, computer scientists, and ontologists. This workshop refined an existing exposure data model and developed several use cases. Sustained community engagement, including the planning of a larger conference and further refinement of the data model.
