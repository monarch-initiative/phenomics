# Mondo Disease Ontology Workshop

**Dates:** November 27-29, 2018  
**Location:** Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA  
**Workshop Organizers:** Nicole Vasilevsky (OHSU), Chris Mungall (LBNL), Melissa Haendel (OHSU/OSU)   

### Focus areas
The Mondo workshop focused on defining ontology patterns and community development processes for ontological disease descriptions. There was a need to provision multiple attributes to a disease for computational classification. The attributes needed to take into account penetrance, expressivity, genetic variation, histology, biomarkers, temporality, somatic and mosaic characteristics, environmental interactions, etc. Additionally, there was a great need for expert clinicians to define clinically relevant navigational grouping classes. These top down and bottom up approaches needed to meet in the middle harmoniously. Further, there was a need to enable expert curation groups such as in ClinGen, EBI, Orphanet, GARD, MedGen, and OMIM to create disease definitions on the fly, capture the provenance and evidence robustly, and have an identifier for use immediately. This workshop consisted of clinicians and ontologists, as well as expert curators curating genes for clinical utility.
