## Workshop goals
- Educate the community about ontologies
- Evaluate how veterinary EHR data can be made interoperable with clinical EHRs using OMOP and FHIR			
- Learn about challenges and define next steps to make data more discoverable and reusable
- Develop a standard, similar to Phenopackets, to represent outcomes of analyses of companion pets and their guardians/owners
  - What can the semantic standards community do to help standardize this available data?
  - What are the next steps in defining database approaches to accomplish this?
- Develop a plan to write a white paper or a position paper on how to reuse Veterinary EHR and OMOP data
- Coordinate the submission of a U01 amongst participating CTSA organizations
