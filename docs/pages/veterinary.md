## Agenda Overview
- **Session 1:** Ontologies/Knowledge Graph Overview
- **Session 2:** Veterinary EHR/OMOP
- **Session 3:** Cancer Biobank
- **Session 4:** Companion pets as sentinels for toxicology and exposure science 
- **Session 5:** What types of animal data are available and where are they stored?
- **Session 6:** Data annotations   

## Workshop goals
- Educate about the community about ontologies
- Evaluate how veterinary EHR data can be made interoperable with clinical EHRs using OMOP and FHIR			
- Learn about challenges and next steps to make data more discoverable and reusable
- Develop a standard (like phenopackets) around how you represent outcomes of analyses of companion pets and their guardians/owners
  - What can semantic standards community do to help standardize this available data?
  - What are next steps in defining the database approaches to this?
- Develop a plan to write a white paper/position paper about how to reuse Veterinary EHR and OMOP data
- Coordinate a U01 submission amongst participating CTSA organizations
